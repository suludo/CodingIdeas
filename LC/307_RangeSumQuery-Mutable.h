//BIT[0...N]
//ARR[0...N-1]
 BIT[i] include M(i) array sums from arr[i-M(i)+1] to arr[i],
 likewise, BIT[i-M(i)] contains M(i-M(i)) sums
 M(i) is the operator 2^(last set digit (digit set to 1) in i)
 if update ARR[i], first update BIT[i] (self includes ARR[i])
 How to find the indices > i that contains #elements > (indices-i) ?
 like, i|....j...indices|
        |  M(indices)   |
 => 2^(index to last set digit) = M(indices) > (indices-i)
 assume indices = 0x[ ABC..XYZ100..00 ], where last set digit is r
 contains ARR sum from ABC..XYZ000..01 to ABC..XYZ100..00, # = 2^r
 whereas i is in the form of abc..xyz0***
 
 
 such that BIT[indices] is updated whenever ARR from ABC..XYZ0001 to ABC..XYZ1000 get updated
 generally BIT[ABC..XYZ100..00] gets updated when ARR[ABC..XYZ000..01] ~ ARR[ABC..XYZ100..00] are muted.

TO BE REVIEWED:
                                      *r*
 logic is this: consider i is abc...xyz100...00
                                       ( n 0's )
 the n lower zeros bits right to the set bit 1, all the rumber starting abc...xyz100...01 to abc...xyz111...11 cannot cover i=abc...xyz100...00, up until (abc...xyz111...11 + 1), where the higher iterative set bit 1 contains definitely more than 2^r number of elements downward, where *r* is the index of lowest set bit of i. Find the next BIT element to be updated is similar following this procedure, i.e. add the last set bit in i, which is i + ( i & -i )

//The idea is based on the fact that all positive integers can be represented as sum of powers of 2. For example 19 can be represented as 16 + 2 + 1. Every node of BI Tree stores sum of n elements where n is a power of 2. For example, in the above first diagram for getSum(), sum of first 12 elements can be obtained by sum of last 4 elements (from 9 to 12) plus sum of 8 elements (from 1 to 8). The number of set bits in binary representation of a number n is O(Logn). Therefore, we traverse at-most O(Logn) nodes in both getSum() and update() operations. Time complexity of construction is O(nLogn) as it calls update() for all n elements.
